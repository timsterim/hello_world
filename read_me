I would love to be a vigilante because I presume my interpretation of morality to objectively correct.  I would start with folks with loud motorcycles.
from there I would probably turn to folks that intentionally spew extra exhaust from their vehicles. 
Acting without regard about others is infraction level, but intentionally inflicting discomfort, in this case with noise and smell is a crime against those affected.
those affected need representation, hence the need for a vigilante.
